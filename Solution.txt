To solve the problem I am creating a tree structure containing all the possible solutions trying to no repeat words in each solution.
When the code finds the first solution I'm just checking for the solutions that improve the current one, if not I am not continue with that specific part of tree.

The solution is presented as a command line application that request for the dictionary file to be in  the following location C:\Windows\Temp\WordList\WordList.txt.
The application ask for the start and stop word and then, after the calculation writes the solution through the console.
